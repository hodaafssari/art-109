      Statement:
      In my artistic journey, my dedication to pushing boundaries and embracing challenges is evident. I channel my
      current mood to fulfill my diverse artistic vision, reflecting my identity as both an artist and an individual.
      From shedding light on societal issues, like the misrepresentation of Muslims in media, to exploring personal
      emotions and life experiences, my creations address a variety of themes, showcasing the depth and breadth of my
      artistic identity.
      I firmly believe in the power of art as a humanitarian tool, aiming to make a positive impact on the world through
      my creative expressions. As viewers engage with my work, I hope they approach it with curiosity, an open mind, and
      a willingness to participate in discussions.
      The boldness and vibrancy of my creations encourage viewers to take a closer look. Throughout my work, there's a
      recurring theme inspired by my own struggles with identity and culture—the overarching belief in finding silver
      linings and utilizing one's tools. Hoda Afssari's art is, above all, a reflection of my multifaceted identity, my
      eagerness to explore new mediums, and my commitment to making a positive impact on the world through creativity.
